As an assignment, you will be creating an app similar to the iOS Contacts app but with a much smaller feature set. 
The screens and features are described in the following sections.


Home Screen

This screen lists all available contacts in the app along with their photo. 
The contacts are fetched from the backend. Along with the list of contacts, it shows which contacts are marked favourite.

Contact Detail Screen

Tapping on a contact in the home screen leads you to the Contact Detail screen. This screen shows the details of the contact such as their phone number, name, image, email address etc. 
ou can call, message and email a contact from this screen as well as mark/unmark them as a favourite.

Edit Contact Screen

apping on the contact button in the Contact Detail screen leads you to this screen. You can edit all fields of the contact in this screen including the contact’s photo. 
Saving the contact’s information should also save it on the backend.


Add Contact Screen

This screen looks similar to the Edit Contact screen. 
Tapping on the Add button in the Home screen leads you to the Add Contact screen. 
Here you can add a new contact to the database along with its phone number, email address, photo, etc. 
All fields of the new contact are mandatory in this screen.
